* Elescope

[[https://github.com/freesteph/elescope/raw/master/elescope-logo.png]]

** Overview

[[https://github.com/freesteph/elescope/raw/master/elescope-demo.gif]]

Most of programming lies in other people's code, and in
Emacs. Elescope brings you the best of both by allowing you to quickly
search and clone any project found on the main forges (*only GitHub at
the moment*, until the author manages to implement other ones).

This package uses [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] and [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][request]].

** Usage
1. Put this package somewhere familiar and load it;
2. ~customize-variable~ ~elescope-root-folder~ to tell Elescope
   where to clone;
3. ~elescope-checkout~.

** Configuration

*** ~elescope-root-folder~

Where to clone repos. No default set.

*** ~elescope-clone-depth~

How deep should the repos be cloned. Defaults to 1 so all clones are
shallow.

*** ~elescope-query-delay~

How long to wait before considering the minibuffer input a valid
query. This helps avoid firing a query for every single letter typed.
Defaults to 0.7 sec and can be set to any value understood by
`run-at-time'."

*** ~elescope-use-full-path~

If non-nil, use the full project path including
username/organisation to clone: cloning 'john/foo' and 'john/bar'
results in two 'foo' and 'bar' clones inside a parent 'john'
folder, as opposed to the default, flat hierarchy of 'foo' and
'bar'.
